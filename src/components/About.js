            About

            Hi there! My name is Joann and I'm a classically trained journalist (went to J-school) and bootcamp-taught software engineer. After a decade of making content for various big lifestyle brands, I decided to pursue my dream of learning how to code. 

            Like magic (with a side of hard work), I'm able to create dynamic mobile-first websites from scratch. 

            As a developer, I thrive to write clean and accessible code--and maintain a can-do attitude. As a human, I strive to spread kindness and positivity. 

            Likes: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, baking, hiking, reading.
