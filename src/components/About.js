                Hi there! My name is Joann and I'm a classically trained journalist (went to J-school) and bootcamp-taught software engineer. After a decade of making content for various big lifestyle brands, I decided to pursue my dream of learning how to code. 
                <br/>
                Like magic (with a side of hard work), I'm able to create dynamic mobile-first websites from scratch. 
                <br/>
                As a developer, I thrive to write clean and accessible code--and maintain a can-do attitude. As a human, I strive to spread kindness and positivity.
